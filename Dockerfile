# Pin to a known-good upstream commit instead of tracking master HEAD. The pin
# gives reproducible image builds plus a CI gate (decode-smoke + the standalone
# boot-test run on every bump), independent of upstream master moving under us.
# It originally also worked around master being briefly uncompilable
# (wmbusmeters/wmbusmeters#1940, util.h missing <ctime>, 2026-06-11) — long fixed
# — but the pin stays for reproducibility, not just that incident.
#
# Bumped ad20d83a (2.0.0-541) -> ac4f2953 (tag 3.0.0, 2026-06-17). This is a
# MAJOR upstream release, so it was verified locally before pinning: builds
# clean, passes all 13 golden decode fixtures (tests/fixtures/golden.tsv) with no
# field/value regression, and `--listdrivers` still lists the built-in izar
# driver (123 drivers) consumed by the WebUI catalog below.
# NB: 3.0.0 removed `--listmeters`; the drivers.json step already prefers
# `--listdrivers`, so the legacy fallback there is now historical (harmless).
# A full clone (not --depth 1) is required: the Makefile derives the version
# string via `git describe --tags`. The Alpine build itself is the final gate in
# CI's build + boot-test jobs (local verification above is Ubuntu/WSL).
# A monthly cron (.github/workflows/wmbusmeters-pin-bump.yml) opens a bump PR
# whenever upstream publishes a new release tag; merging it re-runs these gates.

# Add-on-local patches for upstream behaviour we cannot configure around. Each
# one retires itself: the script skips a patch as soon as upstream grows its own
# handling, and FAILS the build if a patch no longer applies, so the monthly pin
# bump cannot silently ship without it. See patches/README.md.
